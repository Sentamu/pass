        <h1>OUR STRATEGY</h1>
        <p>
          To evangelize the lost and get converts. To establish the converts and get disciples. To equip the disciples and get workers who are able to repeat the cycle. To train the workers one on one and get leaders who are able to repeat the entire cycle and to guide workers behind and along them – using consistent training at all levels.
        </p>


        <h1>OUR CORE VALUES</h1>
        <p>
          1.  We value the Great Commission with Need-oriented evangelism – Where we seek to touch all souls with the gospel of our Lord and afterwards guide all willing converts to Mature Discipleship through consistent follow up and man to man training. Matt. 28:19-20<br/>
          <br/>2.  We value Passionate Spirituality where Holiness, and Prayer and Fasting in all their different but true biblical forms (Matt. 7:7-11; Mark 1:35; James 5:13-18) as well as Hearing, Reading, Studying, Meditating, Memorizing and Applying of the Word in all truthfulness (Acts 2:42) are done with a burning zeal.<br/>
          <br/>3.  We value Small Groups as one of the most effective means of fellowshipping, building relationships, caring for each other, stimulating spiritual growth and developing leaders. Acts 2:46<br/>
         <br/> 4.  We value Empowering Leadership, where the top leadership of the church spells out clear and well laid out goals and delegates authority to gifted people whom they have trained or coached to do the job, but retain the authority to monitor and train them further as they deem it necessary. <br/>
          <br/>5.  We value Training at all Levels (2Tim. 2:2) because we believe that the main responsibility of pastors and teachers in the local church is to prepare God’s lay people for the work of ministry (or service). Eph. 4:12<br/>
          6.  We value Peoples’ Giftedness. We acknowledge that God has given each of us the ability to do certain things well. We therefore encourage believers to discover and exercise their spiritual gifts. Rom. 12:6; 1Cor. 7:7; 1Pet. 4:10<br/>
          <br/>7.  We value Teamwork. We know that the church is a body and that each part can only effectively operate in conjunction with others. 1Cor. 12:27; Ec. 4:9
         <br/> <br/>8.  We value Numerical Growth – pursuing methods and policies which will bring more people in the church, without compromising in any way our integrity or our commitment to biblical truth, because we realize that the first church was always increasing in numbers. Acts 2:47
          <br/><br/>9.  We value innovation. We believe that intelligent people are always open to new ideas. In fact, they look for them. Pro. 18:15
          <br/><br/>10.  We value service. Matt. 20:28; Acts 13:36; Gal. 5:13
          11.  We value all people development. We therefore explore and cultivate the best means how to cater for all the different age groups – the children, the youth, young adults and adults. We value vibrant youth and young adults groups who are committed to participation in the cause of God.
        <br/> <br/> 12.  We value community outreach via all possible programs that enable us to respond to the greatest needs in our community – programs which allow us to sow seeds of love and kindness that will result in people coming to faith.
          13.  We value strong Loving Relationships with every member and visitor feeling accepted into the family and missed when they don’t show up.
          <br/><br/>14.  We value Inspiring Worship Services where the presence of God is fully cultivated with the best music, powerful and constructive Word, where operation of gifts of the Holy Spirit such as deliverance and others is encouraged, where both the lost and saved are catered for.
          <br/><br/>15.  We value Excellence. We believe that the God of our salvation deserves the best we can offer even as Paul the Apostle tells us, Col. 3:23. Therefore in the ministries and activities of Passover Harvest Church we will seek to maintain a high standard of excellence in all we do as well as the spiritual and physical appearance of all our facilities.
